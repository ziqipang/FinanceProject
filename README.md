## Compute Lagged Return

The core pipeline of this part is in the `data_manipulation.py`. 
Follow the procedure in the `main` section and you will get a lagged return of your desired funds, 
in requested time period, of wanted length.

## Visualization

This part is in code `visualize.py`. We currently support visualization of:
* How many funds occurs in the seasons?
* How long does the data of a fund covers?
